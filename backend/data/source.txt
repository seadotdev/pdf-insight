BOTT LIMITED
STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The principal activity of the Company is that of the manufacture and installation of industrial storage equipment and in-vehicle
conversion.
BUSINESS REVIEW
The Company remains focused on its main objective of being a key contributor to the long-term profitability of the Bott Group and
seeks to achieve this by maximising sales revenues, whilst driving down costs of operation.
Active market research provides valuable
insights which, when combined with continuous improvement of products, services and pracesses, enables the Company to deliver
fit-for-purpose solutions for its clients.
The market leading solutions provided by Bott Limited are a direct result of the ongoing investment in innovation and technological
excellence. Over £1m of the in-year capital investment profile has been dedicated to state of the art manufacturing equipment.
Commitment to the exact detailing of product management within the business is evident within the 2022 product launch of the uno3
racking range. Initiation of new digital tooling initiatives are opening further progressive design opportunities. These opportunities are
being maximised by Bott Limited’s valuable intellectual capital; in-house expertise that has been further nurtured in year by extensive
training and development programmes. The business dedicates these investments as an acknowledgement of the ongoing change in
industry, muted global economies and the need to be tenacious in an ever challenging landscape.
Bott Limited achieveda final revenue figure of £52,870,243, which was 38% higher than the previous year. Pre-tax net profit for 2022
was £3,023,735, 91% higher than the result achieved in 2021. The Board are delighted to recognise such a strong return of revenue
following the recent years of disruption during the pandemic; particularly when vehicle availability and wider supply chains are still in
recovery. Profit levels have been equally robust, despite a significant further increase in costs during the year. Whilst cost of sales in
year has trended above prior levels due to resource, raw material and commodity increases, the business has mitigated the impact
through strict overhead controls. Close focus on operational process efficiencies should support the business in unlocking further
benefits over the course of the next few years.
The 2023 year is already demonstrating a full orderbook and Bott Limited works at optimum pace in order to fulfil additional customer
requirements wherever possible. However, the planned revenue within the vehicle conversion business relies heavily on vehicles being
available when scheduled; deviations to timing may directly impact the fulfillment of the orderbook. Whilst the business hopes to see a
level of organic growth in turnover for the year,
it is fully aware that ever increasing costs will continue to challenge profits. Ongoing
internal improvements are a priority in order to provide the agility to tackle these external forces.

BOTT LIMITED
STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board continues to assert that the Company is in a financially robust position, proven through resilience during the impact of
Covid-19 and Brexit in 2020 and 2021; followed by the regrettable impact of the Eastern European conflict and the cost crisis
experienced globally within 2022. Consistent, robust controls of overhead costs and working capital have ensured that the business
balance sheet remains in a strong position. This balance sheet strength has enabled Bott Limited to participate in supporting Group
initiatives, demonstrating the strength of firm intercompany alignment.
Although the local recovery from the impact of Covid-19 is largely complete, other unanticipated factors continue to provide challenges
to the business. The ongoing crisis within Ukraine not only signifies extreme political and humanitarian uncertainty but also continues to
drive unprecedented cost rises. The extent of these issues is still uncertain and the business recognises that it must remain alert and
resourceful in order to fulfil its contracts and obligations. However, Bott Limited is well versed in caring for employee, customer and
supplier welfare and absolutely remains capable in supporting Ukrainian refugees with work and wellbeing, should the opportunity
arise.
Risks continue to surround the marketplace
in general with regards to material supply and price increases (particularly around
commodity items such as steel, oil, plastics and gas). We continue to monitor and manage this situation, adapting our procurement
activities accordingly to remain as efficient as possible at all times.
We continued to invest, despite the global challenges,
in our facilities, plant, digital tools, product and talent development.
It is
recognised that the world is changing and Bott Limited continue to obtain the right resources to adapt, grow and thrive.
OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Company is committed to conducting its business in an ethically responsible manner and this commitment has been recognised in
that the operating and management systems have been certified as meeting the standards required by ISO 45001 (Occupational
Health and Safety Management), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) as well as ISO 9001 (Quality Management). The topic of
corporate, social and environmental governance continues to be greatly important to the business and 2022 saw the launch of the Bott
Limited ESG Steering Committee. This dedicated, interdisciplinary group of mindful employees focus on all areas of the Company to
ensure Bott Limited is pro-active in absolute sustainability, community protection and environmental kindness.
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH DUTY TO PROMOTE THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY
The Board takes its Companies Act Section 172 duty to promote the success of the Company very seriously and considers the
companies stakeholders when making decisions.
The Board, both individually and together, consider that they have acted in the way they consider.
in good faith, would be most likely to
promote the success of the Company for the benefit of it's members as a whole (having regard to the stakeholders and matters set out
in $172 (1) (a-f) of the Companies Act 2006) in the decisions taken during the year. The Board intention is to behave responsibly
towards all shareholders and treat them fairly and equally, ensuring all benefit from the successful delivery of plan. The Board of
Directors has overall responsibility for determining the Company's purpose, values and strategy and for ensuring high standards of
governance. The primary aim of the Board is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company, generating value for
shareholders and contributing to wider society. Key stakeholders include employees, shareholders, suppliers, customers, creditors and
others of the business.
It is essential to maintain open and transparent communications with all parties to ensure relationships are
supported and progressed.
Bott Limited employees have received quarterly presentations from the Board, engagement via Company
social media, video conferences and consistent written updates. Wider business stakeholders have also received dedicated
engagement via visual and written media. The Board considers stakeholder relations imperative for the development and success of
the business and will continue to prioritise clear and engaging communications moving forward.

BOTT LIMITED
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic report, the Directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to
prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
.
select suitable accounting policies for the Company's financial statements and then apply them consistently;
:
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
.
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
.
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

BOTT LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BOTT LIMITED
OPINION
We have audited the financial statements of Bott Limited (the 'Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2022, which comprise the
Statement of income and retained earnings, the Statement of financial position, the Statement of cash flows and the related notes,
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
.
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of its profit for the year then ended;
.
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
.
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit
in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least
twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this
report.
OTHER INFORMATION
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and
our Auditors’
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained
in the course of the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves.
If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

BOTT LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BOTT LIMITED (CONTINUED)
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
.
the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
.
the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not
identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion:
.
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not
visited by us; or
:
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
.
certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
.
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 8, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either
intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Page 10


BOTT LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BOTT LIMITED (CONTINUED)
AUDITORS‘ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected ta influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances af non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:
.
We have considered the nature of the sector, contral environment and financial performance;
.
We have considered the results of enquiries with management in relation to their own identification and assessment of the risk of
irregularities within the entity;
:
We have reviewed the documentation of key processes and controls and performed walkthroughs of transactions to confirm that
the systems are operating in line with documentation; and
.
We have considered the matters discussed among the audit engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the
financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.
As a result of these procedures, we have considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud
and identified the highest area of risk to be in relation to revenue recognition.
In common with all audits under ISAs (UK) we are
required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.
We have also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Company operates in focusing on provisions
of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The key laws and regulations we considered
in this context included the UK Companies Act, FRS 102 and UK tax
legislation.
In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but
compliance with which may be fundamental to the Company's ability to operate or avoid a material penalty, including Health and
Safety, ISO accreditations, Employment Law and Data Protection legislation.
Our procedures to respond to the risks identified included the following:
.
Reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of
relevant laws and regulations described as having direct effect on the financial statements:
.
Enquiring of management concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
.
Performing
analytical procedures to
identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate
risks of material
misstatement due to fraud;
.
Reviewing Board meeting minutes;
.
Performing detailed transactional testing in relation to the recognition of revenue with a particular focus around year end cut-off;
and.
.
In addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries, and other
adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of potential bias; and
evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of the business.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risk to all engagement team members and
remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.
Page 11


BOTT LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BOTT LIMITED (CONTINUED)
Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, recognising that the risk
of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from an error, as fraud may
involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are inherent limitations in the
audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's
website at: www frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ report.
USE OF OUR REPORT
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them
in an Auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022
1.
GENERAL INFORMATION
The company is a private company, limited by shares and registered in England and Wales (registered number: 01325869).
The registered office address is Bude-Stratton Business Park, Bude, Cornwall, EX23 8LY.
2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1
BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these
accounting
policies and
in accordance with
Financial
Reporting Standard
102, the Financial
Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company's accounting policies (see note
3).
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
2.2
GOING CONCERN
The Company generated a profit before tax of £3,023,735 in 2022 (2021: £1,586,385) and at the year end date held net
current assets of £9,314,159 (2021: £10,609,026).
In preparing profit and cash flow forecasts for a period of 12 months from the approval of the financial statements,
management have considered the Company's performance during the 2022 financial year, the impact of the eastern
European conflict, cost increases and other events and conditions that could create economic uncertainty. Management
forecasts anticipate further revenue and profit growth in 2023 and sufficient available funding facilities for
a minimum of 12
months following approval of the financial statements.
2.3.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Functional and presentation currency
The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions.
At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-monetary items measured
at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items measured
at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at period-end
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss except
when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.4
REVENUE
Revenue is recognised to the extent that
it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,
excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before
revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
.
the Company has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer;
:
the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership
nor effective control over the goods sold;
.
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
.
it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the transaction; and
:
the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
2.5
OPERATING LEASES: THE COMPANY AS LESSEE
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.6
LEASED ASSETS: THE COMPANY AS LESSEE
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets. Assets
acquired by finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Assets acquired by
hire purchase are depreciated over their useful lives. Finance leases are those where substantially all of the benefits and
risks of ownership are assumed by the company. Obligations under such agreements are included in creditors net of the
finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is charged to profit or loss so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period.
2.7
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to expenditure on tangible fixed
assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the depreciation on the assets to which the grant relates. The
deferred element of grants is included in creditors as deferred income.
Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Statement of income and retained earnings in the same period as the
related expenditure.
2.8
FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest method so that the amount
charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of
the associated capital instrument.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.9
PENSIONS
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN
The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Company
has no further payment obligations.
The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in
accruals asa
liability in the Statement of financial position. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Company
in independently administered funds.
2.10 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except that a charge
attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised
directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates and generates income.
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the
reporting date, except that:
.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and
.
Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax allowances have
been met.
Deferred
tax balances are not recognised
in
respect of permanent differences except
in respect of business
combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired and the
future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount
that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date.
2.11 TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated
at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
At each reporting date the company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.11 TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS (CONTINUED)
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual
value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.
Depreciation is provided on the following basis:
Freehold property
- 10 to 50 years
Plant and machinery
- 3 to 20 years
Motor vehicles
- 1 to 10 years
Fixtures and fittings
- § to 10 years
The assets’ residual values, useful
lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively
if
appropriate, or if there is an indication ofa significant change since the last reporting date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
in profit or loss.
2.12 STOCKS
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less costs to complete
and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase ona
first in, first out
basis. Work in progress and finished goods
include labour and attributable overheads.
At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment.
If stock is impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its
selling price less costs to complete and sell. The impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
2.13 DEBTORS
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment.
2.14 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not
more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the
date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.
In the Statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on
demand and form an integral part of the Company's cash management.
2.15 CREDITORS
Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.16 PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES
Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Company a legal or constructive obligation that
probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
Provisions are charged as an expense to profit or loss in the year that the Company becomes aware of the obligation, and
are measured at the best estimate at the reporting date of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, taking into
account relevant risks and uncertainties.
The company recognises a provision for warranty claims in respect of potential problems with manufactured goods. This
is measured at the estimated costs to rectify any problems in relation to historical claims and current year sales.
2.17 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of financial assets and
liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other third parties, loans to and from related
parties.
Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year}, including loans and other accounts
receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade
debtors and creditors, are measured,
initially and subsequently,
at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other
consideration expected to be paid or received.
Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for
objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the
Statement of income and retained earnings.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of financial position when there is
an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
2.18 DIVIDENDS
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
3.
JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of the financial statements requires managementidirectors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues
and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ fram those
estimates.
Whilst there is a level of assumption in the judgements and estimates applied, the Directors feel these are unlikely to have a
significant effect on, or cause material error to the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
